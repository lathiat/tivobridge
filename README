TiVoBridge is a packet repeater for both the TiVo discovery beacon and (if 
enabled) Multicast DNS protocols.  It is intended as a way for TiVo boxes 
and other devices or programs that use either of those (normally 
single-subnet) protocols to see each other across routers in a complex 
local network.

When the daemon starts, it opens a raw socket for forwarding, as well as 
listener sockets for both protocols that it works with.  A configuration 
file is used to direct packet forwarding operations for both protocols, 
which may be tailored to fit nearly any network configuration.

Installation
------------
Read the INSTALL file for generalized installation instructions.

Multicast DNS
-------------
Multicast DNS forwarding is an optional feature of this program, and is 
not enabled by default.  To enable this protocol, use the --enable-mdns 
option when running the configure script.

Example Configuration
---------------------
An example network configuration, along with match TiVoBridge 
configuration files, is contained in the file doc/conf-example.txt.
