This example assumes 3 subnets with the following configuration:
- 10.3.0.0/24 and 10.2.0.0/24 connected by router A with interfaces
  10.3.0.254 and 10.2.0.1, with 224.0.0.251 routed to 10.3.0.0/24
- 10.1.0.0/24 and 10.2.0.0/24 connected by router B with interfaces
  10.1.0.254 and 10.2.0.2, with 224.0.0.251 routed to 10.1.0.0/24
- Devices on networks 10.3.0.0/24 and 10.1.0.0/24 can communicate
  freely with each other (no NAT or anything involved)
- TiVo boxes are located at 10.3.0.15 and 10.1.0.10, with a PC running
  TiVo desktop at 10.1.0.15
- Devices using the TiVo beacon and Multicast DNS protocols on those
  two subnets need to see each other, with no consideration to the
  one connecting them

TiVo beacon forwarding must use the original source IP, as that is how the 
receiver will recognize it, so do not use "origin" parameters.  Multicast 
DNS packets, on the other hand, must be sent from a machine on the same 
subnet as the receiver to be seen as valid by the receiver.  Multicast 
responses and announcements contain the IP addresses of the advertisted 
services, though, so this is not a problem.
